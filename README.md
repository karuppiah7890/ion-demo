# ion-demo

This is a demo of how to run [ion](https://github.com/pion/ion) and check it
out! :)

```
$ mkdir pion
$ git clone https://github.com/pion/ion
$ docker-compose up
$ # that's it!
```

And now I went to http://localhost:8080 and typed a room ID and name and boom!

I wanted to try out the flutter app, but was too lazy to checkout the source
code, or the apk. Looks like there's some code here - 

https://github.com/pion/ion/tree/master/sdk/flutter

But it asks to run it with flutter. My disk space is too small. Need to fix it
ðŸ™ˆ Not gonna download and run flutter for now. But to try in my mobile, I
decided why not browser? And tried it, but it didn't workout with firefox.
Actually, even in desktop, there was some issue with firefox, but in desktop I
used firefox developer edition which could have bugs, hence a few warnings
and errors in my console! 

I finally used chrome in desktop and mobile too. But in mobile, it couldn't
capture my video or audio input. I guess some permission issues of sorts or
some bug. But I could see the video feed from my desktop to the mobile browser!
It was super cool! :)

I also tried desktop sharing. That worked too! :)

Hmm, cool stuff :)
